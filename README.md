# Surf's Up! Data Analysis

## Overview
W.Avy is proposing a new surf shop on Oahu, Hawaii. As an experienced surfer and shop owner, he knows the importance of setting up shop in a location with ideal weather.
In order to ensure that the weather on Oahu will support a successful shop, we set out to examine summary temperature statistics for the island of Oahu from 2010 - 2017. 

## Results
### June
- 1. From 2010 to 2017, there were 1700 temperature readings recorded in the month of June. This should provide us ample material to analyze the June weather. 
- 2. The average June temperature was approximately 75 degrees. According to IBA World Tour, 75 degrees is an ideal temperature for surfing, with most surfers requiring only a 1-2 mm neoprene top. (source: https://ibaworldtour.com/do-you-need-a-wetsuit-in-75-degree-water/)
-- This ideal average temperature means many surfers will be hitting the waves in June in Oahu. This ensures plenty of customers for the new surf shop.
- 3. Additionally, the minimum temperature recorded in June is 64 degrees. At this temperature, surfers will be able to surf all day with a simple full-body wetsuit. The maximum temperature is 85 degrees. Surfers may not need a wetsuit on these hotter June days, but they will still be comfortable in the water.
-- The full temperature range in June should be comfortable for surfers. This ensures that the surf shop will have heavy traffic throughout June. 

### December
- 1. From 2010 to 2017, there were 1517 temperature readings recorded in the month of Decemeber. This should provide us ample material to analyze the December weather.
- 2. The average December temperature was approximately 71 degress. Similarly to June, this average temperature is an excellent temperature for surfers. 
-- Oahu should continue to see surfers throughout the majority of December. 
- 3. The minimum temperature recorded in December is 56 degrees. This is not an ideal temperature for surfing. However, according to Men's Journal (source: https://www.mensjournal.com/sports/7-winter-surfing-tips-to-keep-you-from-freezing-to-death/7-start-warm-stay-warm/) there is a market for "Winter Surfing."
-- On the 25% of the month where the temperature dips below 69 degrees, the surf shop may be able to profit off these adventure-seekers by offering deals on 4-6mm wetsuits to keep these surfers warm.
-- Since 75% of the month sees temperatures over 69 degrees, the majority of December days should still be comfortable for most surfers. 

## Summary 
These initial data sets prove that there will be people surfing throughout the year on the island of Oahu. This ensures heavy traffic for the potential surf shop, and should encourage investors that this location could be ideal for this business venture.
However, I believe that it would be valuable to...
- a. perform the same statistical analysis for precipitation in June and December. 
- b. visualize the temperatures and precipitation levels for June and December to ensure that there are plenty of days in which precipitation is low and temperatures are comfortable.
